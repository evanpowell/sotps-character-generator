  "For days and nights an incessant ringing haunted you, one that no one else seemed to hear. For fear it would drive you mad, you left your bed late at night and began digging near the old stump at the edge of the settlement where the sound was at its loudest. Suddenly your torchlight was overcome by a piercing white flash, and the ringing stopped. At the foot of the stump rested a gleaming, eight-pointed trinket. It called out to you. As you wrapped your fingers around its shimmering points, it began to sing as you felt every piece of yourself tear apart and float above among the clouds themselves. The sun and moon soared rapidly around you again and again and again, until time seemed trivial in the face of your broadened awareness. Memories of where you had come from seemed to fade, and you spent what felt like days peering at shimmering lights across the vast Empire below. Then just as suddenly you returned to the ground. It was now late afternoon. A crowd had gathered, murmuring, staring at you sitting in a crudely-dug hole and clutching a strange stone. You wondered just how long you had been there.",
  "One afternoon as you traveled close to the road's edge, a twisted tree that seemed out of place felt too interesting to leave uninvestigated. As you approached, you could feel your heart rate increase, and it was as if the world around the tree darkened. Apprehension loomed over the road side as the tree began to move now in the way trees shouldn't, twisting further, its branches pointing toward you, beckoning you. Clusters of thin, glowing, radiant crystals began to form along the branches as if dripping or growing rapidly. Compelled to reach toward them, whether with your hands or your thoughts you would not recall, the crystals reached back, shattering and climbing into your skin in rapid and painful sprawls. You began to see visions of a great battle of the gods. Gathered around a white, glowing beacon, they fought as you could only stand in their vast halfhollows to watch. Their wounds dripped icy blood and you soon realized that you felt light headed. As your mind returned to the roadside the tree was black and smoldering. Your screams were carried north by the winds. ",
  "At the center of a clearing you encountered a flat, smooth, disc of crystalline stone. It had a pale greenish-blue tint, and seemed unlike anything you had ever encountered. Alone in the clearing you cautiously approached the disc and reached out to pick it up. Just as your fingers touched the edge, the whole of the disc splintered and shattered into countless small shards. Reality around you shattered in turn, revealing dark images of strange, underground locales where lightning vines and bleeding crystals all pointed toward the heart of a great beast below. It had the horned head of a great ox and the mouth of a wolf, the body of a bear but with great long fingers and extending claws. It stood on the legs of a northern bison. It reached toward you with a beckoning gesture. You screamed yourself awake, and in the clearing you saw that many of the shards of pale stone had buried themselves into your skin. It was there that you blacked out. ",
  "In a strange happenstance along a roadside as you were feeling hungry for a meal, you spied a carved trinket of bone, as if someone had dropped along their ride south. The trinket was elaborately made, and at its center was inlaid a pale, but radiant alabaster. As you reached the trinket, you picked it up. When the stone touched your palm, you began to feel intense pain. Your screams brought nearby woodworkers to the roadside, but you never noticed them. Your awareness instead was overwhelmed by visions of a far-off place, a large ruin deep within a jungle. Images of the gods were etched in the ruin's entrance, telling stories of the creation of a grand beacon. As you moved deeper into the structure, stones began to light the massive walls one by one, illuminating a large chamber. It became unbearably hot, and suddenly the far side of the chamber burst like a dam, and lava began to flow toward you. In a fever you blacked out. ",
  "At the water's edge one morning, you saw a glowing light from beneath the surface and felt compelled to get a closer look. Eight fish encircled a glowing stone. They scattered as you approached, though they did not stir the waterbed, and you could clearly see the green and black swirls of the stone's eight points. As you reached for the pale stone, it reached back, gifting your mind with visions that overshadowed the screams of locals. Your gaze transported to a grassland, plains as far as the eye could see, with a purple sky above. Before you was a great ruin, and a god poured glowing liquid into a great urn. As the urn filled to its brim, the door to the ruin opened revealing an empty chasm. Suddenly you were falling into that chasm, and you began to scream before you returned to yourself, having fully submerged with the eight-pointed stone still in your grasp. ",
  "Outside your settlement amid a collection of rocks and foliage, you felt pulled to search the rubble until you found a flat, rough stone of a pale orange and green hue. You reached out to grab the stone and get a closer look, but as you touched it, the stone let out a massive burst of energy and a painfully low tone, exploding the earth and creating a sink hole just beneath you. You fell a short distance into a small stone chamber, and the pale stone fell directly next to you, shattering into pieces and fine dust. Coughing, you could not help but inhale some of that fine dust, and suddenly you felt enveloped in a blinding white light. Pain seared across your body and though you tried to scream, no sound emerged. Then, just as suddenly, you felt the light pull away from you like a rushing wind. Just before losing consciousness, you could see you had somehow appeared miles from your home. ",
  "An acquaintance of yours with whom you had exchanged regular greetings mysteriously went missing, and so you intended to investigate around your settlement. After searching for clues and asking several people where they might be, you learned that they were last seen heading south into a thicket of foliage. Others had searched the area, but to no avail. Following the trail yourself, you discovered several small pebble-sized pale-blue stones at the center of a clearing. Just as you moved closer, they slowly began to float from the ground and circle around you, beginning to pulse and glow. Then you began to feel as if your skin were tearing apart from all sides; you felt lighter, almost weightless, but your chest was pounding and your flesh was in agony. Visions of large metal chambers flooded your mind, surrounded by gods whose voices were lightning and whose bodies were stone. In the blink of an eye you felt your weight return, and you fell in a heap on the rocks along the ocean's coast. The waves crashed next to you, and there too was your missing acquaintance. The noise of the ocean was the last thing you remember before blacking out. ",
  "In the midwinter months while warming outside by a fire, one of the ringstones you had placed around the embers exploded with a loud pop. Shockingly, light began to radiate from the core of the burst stone, and the other people who had gathered around the fire fled in fear. Feeling compelled to get a closer look, you leaned toward the radiant stone. It was a fist-sized shard that was translucent but brilliant. You reached out to test if the pale stone was too hot to touch, but as soon as your fingers reached the edge, your mind flooded with visions of deep, underground caverns, where lightning vines were striking the ground in intervals. Just as you were beginning to sense a pattern within those intervals, you felt a firm crack of pain on your arm. You looked up to see a woman holding a pole of some kind. She had struck your arm to break your connection with the shard of stone. You collapsed soon after.",
  "It was a restless night of sleep; your dreams were like nightmares, filling you with visions of faraway lands, thunderous battles among the gods, of great wolves eating their prey under a purple moon, and of flashes of lightning extending not from the clouds but from the spires of the bald mountains surrounding you. Suddenly you awoke in such intense pain that you barely became aware you were no longer in your bed and you were somehow covered in dirt and sweat. The intensity of the pain obscured the peculiarity of how it must have been in your dream state that you had dug a shard of pale stone from beneath a standing stone more than a mile from your home. The glowing stone brightly seared an eight-pointed pattern into your left palm and you felt as if just for a moment you could see thousands of these radiant tears shimmering and calling to you from across the vast Empire. It was then that you lost consciousness.",
  "Tales of the mystical tree trunks hiding at the center of the forest are common around the Empire. Most regions have their own version of the tale, told to children to hint to both the danger and mystery of being alone in the forest. Yet one afternoon as you were making your way home through a thicket of trees, there in cool light was a bright, mystical stump, petrified and out of place. As you approached, you could plainly see a fist-sized shard of brilliant, translucent stone. It seemed to be floating in the core of the stony trunk, and it began to call out to you. As you grasped at the stone and began to remove it from its invisible perch, the petrified stump began to crumble into dust and dance across the leaves of the forest floor. As you closed your eyes to avoid the disintegrating trunk, a booming sound greater than thunder hurled your mind into visions of a great metal god whose jaws were eating the earth. It continued to devour until the earth around you had fallen away, and you, too, began to fall into a bright light. Then you opened your eyes, and found yourself standing among a group of strangely-dressed people. As one began to utter unknown words, you fell unconscious, still clutching that strange, pale shard.",
  "It was difficult to remember what had happened. The memories came and went, fleetingly, like grasping at the events of a dream from the waking world. Somehow, you thought, in the midst of a rainy night, you followed a glowing light that appeared to be a few hundred yards toward the edge of your settlement. But as you reached that light, it was midday under a cloudless sky. It could have just as easily started as midday, and ended standing in the dark rains before an intricately carved bone trinket inlaid with pale greenish stone. The disorienting haze of your thoughts felt like a melding of realities and possibilities. It might have been that you reached out to take that trinket, or perhaps the pale stone reached out to you. The swirling of images left you crying out in confusion—or perhaps pain? Or were you the wolf of your memory howling at the lightning of the storm? Was it real? Would you be able to remember? It all faded to black.",
  "While in the wilds near your settlement, you discovered an old rock cairn atop a pile of rubble. Sifting through the stones, you found a buried cache of equipment—tools, weapons, armor—all rusted and ruined from weather. There at the center of the ruined breastplate were five brilliant pale blue stones. As soon as you picked up the armor piece, the stones began to radiate light, and the whole plate began to vibrate and break apart. It might have been your imagination, but arcs of lightning bolted out of the stones and out of the rock cairn, and soon you were overwhelmed by thoughts of a grand ruin that looms in the distant hills. Then one of the sprawling beams of purple lightning struck you, and you lost consciousness.",
  "You could not recall how or why, but you found yourself in the wilds outside a ruin only rumored to be near your home. There, in the midday light, you discovered a small metal chamber in the heart of a large, cube of granite at the entrance to the structure. Compelled to find out what was inside, you forced open the front of the metal chamber, revealing a translucent, radiant stone with a tapered shape and eight sharp points. It began to reverberate—almost singing—and it filled the small stone chamber with a brilliant white light. You reached out and grabbed the stone, and the ruin before you began to shake. The sky grew cold as the entrance to the structure cracked and fell apart, and when you could peer inside you saw a vast chamber where a large glowing beacon was casting bolts of lightning outward. Several gods surrounded the beacon, and they were eating the light. Still clutching the stone, you fell to the ground. ",
  "In the late summer, you saw someone near your home that you hadn't seen before. Seeing them leave the settlement at nightfall, they would always return the next morning covered in dirt, sand, and grime. This continued several nights until you were too curious to leave it alone. You followed them in secret, keeping your distance as they traveled the road south, then next to a red dogwood thicket, they turned from the road. You crept along their trail, moving quietly until you could see them at the center of a clearing chiseling away at a standing stone. You waited and waited, nearly falling asleep until you heard them cry out an affirmation, setting their tools on the ground. Suddenly, the meek torchlight was overwhelmed by a bright white light that emanated from the stone. The mysterious person pulled a flat disc of pale blue stone from the heart of the standing stone, but suddenly their smile shifted to confusion and pain. The disc shattered into hundreds of shards, tearing through the excavator's skin and branching outward. Now you too began to feel painful cuts along your own skin. As you frantically fell into the clearing, brushing your arms and neck, you began to feel heat within you, and lightning began to bolt from the top of the standing stone. ",
  "One cloudy day, a mile south of your settlement, you came upon an unsettling formation of stones in the wilds east of the path. At first you felt a vibration that drew you through the thicket. That is where you encountered it. The formation was arranged in a spiral pattern, but each of the stones strangely hovered a few inches from the ground underneath them, which consisted of a large, flat marker stone. The vibrations increased the closer you walked to the stones, until suddenly they stopped. You proceeded atop the marker stone to gaze at the cluster toward the center of the formation—five bluish-green pale pebbles resting on a weathered metal cylinder. Suddenly the formation reacted to your presence; the ground stones were thrust away and the pale pebbles began to float and surround you, turning faster and faster. Beneath you the marker stone seemed as if it began to glow a brilliant white light. Then that light enveloped you, and the last thing you remembered before blacking out were the sounds of what you thought were wolves howling, their cries remaining at the top of their voice until a sudden silence. ",
  "The awareness of when it happened never remained with you, but you did remember clearly the visions you saw that night when you found a jagged and radiant shard of translucent stone near your home. Somehow you found that twist of bluish stone in your hands, and your world began to unravel, the landscape bursting away into a bright light and a dull hum. Gods surrounded you, hovering above, their voices booming and echoing. Lightning arced from strange metal beasts and suddenly you were drawn backward into a glowing chamber. Thunderous sounds began to pulse and you felt as if your skin was tearing apart. And then, you were outside yourself—you were a stone, and you could see with ten thousand eyes. Your heart felt strong deep within you but your hands could not move. You felt at once able to glimpse everywhere but move nowhere. In an instant your terrifying screams jolted you back into your mortal body, where you collapsed, unconscious.",
  "In the dead of night, the sound of howling wolves woke you in a panic. Their cries drew you from your bed, out under the night sky, though it seemed as if only you were aware of them as no one else was drawn to the sounds. You wandered out, further and further from your home, and the howls grew louder. Then their screams began to twist and transform into a ringing, reverberating tone that grew even more intense as you continued further into the darkness. What you felt first as the sounds of howling was now inaudible; perhaps it always was. But you could still feel the force and the weight of it, drawing you toward a collection of bones at the site of a fresh wolf kill. The bones were mostly picked clean, but the incessant ringing tone filled you with a sense of urgency and fright. The animal turned its dead face toward you, opening its mouth to reveal a radiant, eight-pointed stone. It was then you awoke, realizing that was all a dream. Yet, there in your blood covered hands, rested the dream stone. Shock overwhelmed you and suddenly you felt light-headed. ",
  "A traveling curio merchant came through your settlement, selling tonics and trinkets from across the Empire. One afternoon on the fourth Rehan of Seed's Rise as the market began to pack up for the day, the merchant beckoned you. He asked if you wanted a gift, and opened a small box to reveal a thin leather bracelet inset with a pale blue stone. He claimed that he had procured this bracelet from the jungles of Plenith and that, if worn, would reveal one's true calling. The merchant insisted that the gods wanted you to have the bracelet, and that he would take no coin for this divine gift. Whether with eagerness or reluctance, you were not sure, you took the merchant's gift and brought it home. Some time later when the merchant moved on—you were not sure how long—you decided to try on the bracelet. Almost as soon as it was secured around your wrist, you watched the leather melt away and the stone began to glow and meld with your skin. And soon you began to see visions of white wolves amid a great pit, in eight rows of eight, each of them beginning to devour the next. It was then that you blacked out. ",
  "You did not remember how or when, but you found yourself in the distant wilds at the entrance to a mysterious cave. There, in the dead of night, you discovered a large, round metal container somehow merged within the heart of a great standing stone. Compelled to discover if you could access the inside of the metal repository, you began to strike the front with a rock until the strange metal began to flake away, revealing an opening. With a stick you pried open a hole large enough for your hand, and reached inside. The inside was remarkably clean and warm, and your hand soon found a smooth, finely-cut stone, symmetrically shaped with a tapered facilitated by clean angles connecting polar points. You removed the stone carefully, remarking at its glow and its generative hum, but it suddenly felt almost too hot to touch. It began to reverberate—almost singing—and it began to surround you with a brilliant white light. The cave's entrance seemed to grow, and grow, looming far overhead until the darkness began to overtake you. The last thing you remembered before you drifted out of consciousness was the lava that seemed to be bubbling up from the cave floor. From the lava emerged a large glowing beacon. It was carved into the shape of a white wolf, and was casting bolts of lightning all around. Still clutching the stone, you fell to the ground. ",
  "On a whispery, moonlit night at the edge of a settlement a strange pool formed along the ground as if filled by an unseen rain. The shimmering pool emptied just as quickly as it had formed, leaving behind a collection of thin, jagged crystals, appearing to glow from within more than from the reflecting moonlight. As you moved closer to get a better view, you suddenly doubled over in pain when a high-pitched screeching sound cut through your ears like the north winter winds. The sound, you realized, was no sound at all but simply pain, a sharp, cutting pain in your temples and jaw that stopped you at the edge of the pool. The thin crystals shattered under the intensity of the frequency, thrusting toward you and cutting your skin. Then suddenly you began to see visions of a white wolf limping in pain. It turned toward you and opened its mouth to speak, but it had no tongue or teeth, only a bright, white light that enveloped you. You were found moments later miles from home, at the steps of the great sacred Temple at the Empire's center. ",
  "During a strange sunset on the last Estahan of Vostiar's Renewal, you noticed a cart full of stones near your settlement. As you approached the cart your body felt a strange tickle under the skin and a fluttering in your gut. The amber glow of the sky around you began to shimmer with purple and green waves of light, and the cart suddenly tipped over spilling out hundreds of stones and crude ore. One stone rolled right up to you, and though light-headed, you felt compelled to smash it with another of the ore stones. As you cracked open the stone, it sang brightly, so much so that everyone in the thoroughfare began to clutch their ears and double over in pain. But to you, the radiant stone's song felt beautiful, and your body began to feel renewed. You reached out and grabbed the stone, its eight sharp points were warm and you began to see visions of a vast, underground cavern full of swinging lighting vines. Eight of the vines in the center of the cavern surrounded a great beacon, and each cast a bolt of lightning in succession which played an eerie, eight-note melody. One of the notes matched the song note of the stone in your hand. Then the vision ended. It was the dead of night, and you realized that you had wandered south of home, now facing the entrance to a small cave.",
